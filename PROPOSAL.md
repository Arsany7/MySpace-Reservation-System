## Project Proposal for Workspace Reservation System
### Names:

### Purpose:
The Workspace Reservation System solves the common problem of complicated and time-consuming table reservations in workspaces. Currently, people struggle to find a table quickly and easily, leading to frustration. Workspace providers also face challenges in managing reservations across multiple branches efficiently. 

The purpose of the proposed software is to design and implement a Workspace Reservation System that facilitates table reservations in workspaces in different locations. This system aims to enhance the overall user experience by providing a user-friendly platform for clients to reserve tables efficiently. This not only saves time for users but also helps workspace providers better organize reservations, leading to smoother operations overall.

### Definitions:
* Client/User: Individuals who wish to reserve tables in workspaces. They must have user accounts for authentication.
* Admin: Administrators responsible for managing the system, confirming new branches, and updating table information.
* Workspace: Physical locations with tables available for reservation.
* Tables: Different table categories, number of seats and reservations.

### Goals and Objectives:
* Develop a user-friendly system allowing clients to easily reserve tables based on their preferences.
* Enable the system to handle reservations for workspaces in multiple branches, with the ability to add new branches.
* Implement a secure user registration and login system to ensure data privacy.
* Provide admin capabilities to confirm reservations, add new branches, add tables, and manage existing table information.
* Provide comprehensive reporting capabilities for the admins showing information about branches, clients and table reservations.
* Focus on creating an intuitive interface for both clients and administrators to enhance overall user experience.

### Plan:
#### Phase 1 - Project Proposal:
Define the problem and present the proposed solution.

Outline the system's purpose, definitions, goals, objectives and await approval.

#### Phase 2 - Software Specification:
Identify and document detailed user and system requirements (functional and non-functional) for the Workspace Reservation System.

Define user stories for client and admin functionalities.

#### Phase 3 – Software Design:
Create system architecture and design diagrams.

Specify the database schema for user accounts, table information, and reservations.

#### Phase 4 – Software Test-Driven Development:
Initiate the development of the Workspace Reservation System using a Test-Driven Development approach. Start by creating automated tests that define the expected behavior of user authentication, reservation processes, admin functionalities, etc... 

Develop the system incrementally, writing code to pass these tests. This iterative approach ensures that each component is thoroughly tested before moving on to the next, promoting robust and reliable software.

#### Phase 5 – System Testing:
Conduct rigorous testing to ensure the system is free of bugs and meets the specified requirements.

Perform user acceptance testing to gather feedback.

#### Phase 6 – Maintenance and Support:
Address any reported issues and consider future enhancements based on user feedback.

### Deliverables:
* UML Diagrams
* Test Codes
* Source Code
* Presentation Video
* Project Report (including Software Requirements, User Manual and Screenshots)
